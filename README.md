# Test-driven-TDD-
Using test code first approach and writing code to make it pass
Test driven development follows 5 industry standdard approach which are 
1 > write the test
2 > test to fail
3 > write test to pass ( write enough code just to let the test pass)
4 > test to pass
5 > Refactor the code (we can now refactor the code that passed the Test)
